# Design Decision
## Information from Onpatient.com
- Except for patient information, also retrieve the last recoreded vital sign from doctor. 
- The reason is that, from patients' perpective, paitents should be care of the last recorded information by visiting the doctor
## Database
- Once patients login successfully, only stored their Patient ID to database, this Patient ID will be associated with Tracker Systems later
## Statistic Visualization 
- Using highcharts.js to display data in a visual way, which is the best way for patients to see all changes
